# MusicAndMentalHealth
This project explores the relationship between music preferences and mental health using the Music and Mental Health (MxMH) dataset. The goal is to identify potential patterns between how frequently individuals listen to specific music genres and their self-reported levels of anxiety, depression, and stress.
